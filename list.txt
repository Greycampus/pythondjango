Control Structures
if-else and elif
1.Print whether a given number is odd and also a multiple of nine
2.print the grade of person using the following conditions
  ->A if percentage >85
  ->A- if %<=85 and >80
  ->B if %<=80 and >70
  ->C if %<=70 and >60
  ->D if %<=60 and >40
  ->E if %<=40 and also should print 'candidate failed' if %<=35
3.find maxima or minima of a given function x^2 -2x + 1 given in form of 1 -2 1
4.Should find whether the given year is leap year or not following the conditions
  The year can be evenly divided by 4, unless;
  The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;
  The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
5.find derivative and integral of polynomial x3 + 4x2 + 2x - 1 given in form of 1 4 2 -1
loops
1.in physics, contact between objects during a collision leads to loss of force as no medium is perfect.
likely we are having n medium in a plane each of equal length followed by qouitient of reduction, In can be well
explained using the following example
person throws a ball on plane from certain height h of n medium your job is to find distance traveled in plane
and the medium is repetted in cyclic order and height is only considered in integers
input:
  3(number of medium)
  4(length of each)
  5(height from which ball is thrown)
  2(distance travelled for each step)
  0.1
  0.3
  0.5
  output:
  first  step 5*0.9= 4 dist = 2
  second step 4*0.9= 3 dist = 4
  third  step 3*0.7= 2 dist = 6
  fouth  step 2*0.7= 1 dist = 8
  fifth  step 1*0.5= 0 dist = 10
  so,the result is 10(ten) steps
2.using loops of your choice and print as follows for a given input
input:
3
9
output:
----a----
---bbb---
--ccccc--
---bbb---
----a----
3.check whether a given number is in a goemetric progression or not for a given initial value and factor
4.using loops make a game to play bulls and cows
5. print the number pyramid of height n(input from user) using a single variable in entire program
  for 3
  1
  11
  111
Datatype recap with loops
1.should find the percentage of a student for input given in following manner
3
rag 78 56 72
teja 83 67 78
bhavana 83 75 67
bhavana
output: 75
2.Should print  the name of student having second least percentage from the given list of students  if
there are multiple students should print multiple students in alphabetical order
5
rag
77
teja
89
bhavana
84
praveen
77
bhadram
75
output:
praveen
rag

3.use array as set  in the program to store only unique items in a array or list
File Handling
1.Open a text file and print all the data in it.
2.open a text file and print the nth line in text file if nth line does not exist print 'no data'
3.open a csv file and print only the second column in the file
4.append two files
Functions
1.Write a function to find gcd of two numbers
2. write a function to find whether a given number is armstrong number or not
3. write a number to generate sequence of primes that are exactly at absoute difference of 1 with powers of two.
4. write a function to find the voting result based on a string input such that a letter
in string belongs to a particular party
5. factorial of a number.
Regular Expressions
1.Extract the mail addresses in the given string using regular expression
2.Find the sum of the numbers in a string 1A2wq1acef31sdac4
3.replace all the patterns like '[!*]' without using loops
4.find the total occurences of a symbol in string using reqular expressions
OOP
1.build a class to store the data of the mobile phones with screen size,ram,company and processor along with Constructor and function to estimate cost of phone based on conditions
  samsung:7000(pr)
  moto:5999
  lenovo:4000
  nokia:6100
  est cost = pr*(scr size/4.0)+pr*(ram/1.0)+pr*(proc/1.0)+0.05*pr
